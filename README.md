localStorage-testApp
====================

HTML5 LocalStorage test webapp (weekend project)
This is an experiment with using HTML5's local storage to store text in your browser.

This web application allows you build an item using the "Add" button at the bottom.
You then name the item you're adding. Then add text to that item with the text box on the right.
You can then save using the button on the bottom as well. 
This will save the text to your browser's local storage and will survive
page reloads and even closing your browser. 
Just come back to this webpage and your content should still be here. 
(Unless you clear your browser cache. This will delete your content.)
